just.. a..

SMAAALL, NUMBER OF CAAATTS
SHOULD BE ENOUUUGHH

For us, to find a way

Baack, back to the paast,
Back to where the Grass is Green
And there's Loads of Women,


[insert verse here]
<potential verse>
Small Wonder
Little birdehh
Catch the ball and [spoken] Oh no i'm sorry you're BIRDS

[---, -^, ^^, ^^^] But the cats, they, do what they can
[slow] And what they do is what we nee-eEED;;

I'm a murderer, you're an asshole
And I really want to make it up to you. One last evil
And maybe we can put this thing to rest?
</potential verse>

No?
Oh.

Just a smaalll, number of caats,
should be enough,
for us, to find a way
fah, blah blah blah-blah,
blah blah blah-blah,
a-find the cute and wring it out


baack, back to the paast,
back to a~when we were young and i was so good

[spoken]
I'm trying to collaborate. I don't see you doing shit
If we work this out like grown-ups maybe we can live full long lives
Together? Or apart. I understand if you're not interested.
But you've got people who love you, and, well, I don't, but
I hope to some day.


BAACK, BACK TO THE PAAST,
Open the caaats,

A-find the cute and wring it out;


Seriously, though, this is the plan. I've got the research.
We open these cats, extract some nutrients and minerals
And your friend - who I didn't mean to kill, by the way - comes back to life
And I regain the part of my soul that I have lost.

It won't hurt. Us, I mean.
I kid. There's anaesthetic, we'll treat them well.
They might be a bit ill for a few days - hopefully - but they'll come through
And a few IQ points less we'll be much richer, and, well, they're fucking cats

You say no and you destroy us both. Seriously, I've got real enemies, not just you,
and they're- oh fuck, the chorus, right-


JUST A SMAAALL NUMBER OF CAATS
AN ANAESTHA-TIIIST
YOUR FRIEND ALIIIVE
AND MY FRIEND, ME,
my life, won't be a waste

So.. what do you say? [music cuts]

Will you be able to overcome your distrust, and let me help you help me help us all?

... -please.
